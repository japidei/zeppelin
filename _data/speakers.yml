  name: "Christian"
  surname: "Adell Querol"
  company: "Schibsted Media Group"
  title: "DevOps Network Engineer"
  bio: "I could sum up myself as an experienced network engineer, currently diving into network automatisation & virtualisation in large scale deployments. Always trying to use Agile Project Management skills together facing technical challenges to finally implement useful solutions.

Moreover, I don't understand networking without a comprehensive knowledge of the services transported on top of it, so this has brought me a deep understanding of the broadcasting industry cutting-edge technologies, specially for streaming and live show production, and now large scale deployments over Internet.

Furthermore, I enjoy sharing my ideas about networking technologies with colleagues and students helping them whilst learning from other points of view too."

  name: "Iñigo"
  surname: "Ortiz de Urbina"
  company: "RIPE NCC"
  title: "Network Engineer"
  bio: "My name is Iñigo Ortiz de Urbina Cazenave, 27yo, Madrid-based network engineer. I come from a technical and research background, mostly due to my involvement with research groups at the universities in which I got my Telecommunications Engineering. I currently work at a small LIR’s NOC dealing with customer support, IPv6 advocacy, design, implementation and education, as well as doing both BGP and DNS maintenance and performing the hostmaster functions (amongst few other functions).

At a personal, non technical level, I am concerned about Internet development in the Middle East, Africa and Latam regions. As such, I understand the importance of quality content to both educate and promote community building in these circles. I do take passive part in many mailing-lists including the *-wg and *NOGs and so think I understand the needs of these communities.

I’ve been explained the duties and workloads expected for this position and feel comfortable with both the tasks and time to allocate for them. I really enjoy reading the slides posted in all the conferences I dont have the chance to attend (Apricots, Nanogs, Menogs, sanog, esnog, ietf meetings, ipv6 task forces and roadshows… you name it) and I think I have a good sense of what constitutes a successful slide the audience can enjoy and learn from.

I am an enthusiastic, cooperative person and have a strong sense of community that can make me suitable for the task. I think this is a very good opportunity for me to meet like-minded people and I hope I can get more involved with the Internet community at large, and the RIPE community in particular, by helping shape the content of the presentations.

You can find me on LinkedIn or Twitter (@ioc32) and I can also provide references, should you require more information."
